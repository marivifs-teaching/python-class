    "### Sections\n",
    "\n",
    "There are well defined sections in a docstring. The sections of a functionâ€™s docstring are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Short summary\n",
    "\n",
    "    A one-line summary that does not use variable names or the function name, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "   \"\"\"The sum of two numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "       The function signature is normally found by introspection and displayed by the help function. For some functions (notably those written in C) the signature is not available, so we have to specify it as the first line of the docstring:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "add(a, b)\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of two numbers.\n",

    "2. Extended Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "A few sentences giving an extended description. This section should be used to clarify functionality, not to discuss implementation detail or background theory, which should rather be explored in the Notes section below. You may refer to the parameters and the function name, but parameter descriptions still belong in the Parameters section.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Description of the function arguments, keywords and their respective types.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters\n",
    "----------\n",
    "x : type\n",
    "    Description of parameter `x`.\n",
    "y : type\n",
    "    Description of parameter `y` (with type not specified)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "Enclose variables in single backticks. The colon must be preceded by a space, or omitted if the type is absent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the parameter types, be as precise as possible. Below are a few examples of parameters and their types.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters\n",
    "----------\n",
    "filename : str\n",
    "copy : bool\n",
    "dtype : data-type\n",
    "iterable : iterable object\n",
    "shape : int or tuple of int\n",
    "files : list of str\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "If it is not necessary to specify a keyword argument, use optional:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x : int, optional\n",
    "Optional keyword parameters have default values, which are displayed as part of the function signature. They can also be detailed in the description:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Description of parameter `x` (the default is -1, which implies summation\n",
    "over all axes).\n",
    "When a parameter can only assume one of a fixed set of values, those values can be listed in braces, with the default appearing first:\n",
    "\n",
    "order : {'C', 'F', 'A'}\n",
    "    Description of `order`.\n",
    "When two or more input parameters have exactly the same type, shape and description, they can be combined:\n",
    "\n",
    "x1, x2 : array_like\n",
    "    Input arrays, description of `x1`, `x2`.\n",
    "4. Returns\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation of the returned values and their types. Similar to the Parameters section, except the name of each return value is optional. The type of each return value is always required:\n",
    "\n",

    "Returns\n",
    "-------\n",
    "int\n",
    "    Description of anonymous integer return value.\n",

    "If both the name and type are specified, the Returns section takes the same form as the Parameters section:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "Returns\n",
    "-------\n",
    "err_code : int\n",
    "    Non-zero value indicates error code, or zero on success.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Other Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "An optional section used to describe infrequently used parameters. It should only be used if a function has a large number of keyword parameters, to prevent cluttering the Parameters section.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Raises\n",
    "\n",
    "An optional section detailing which errors get raised and under what conditions:\n",
    "\n",

    "Raises\n",
    "------\n",
