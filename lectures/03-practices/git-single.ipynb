    "  ```\n",
    "  $ git init .\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  If we do `ls` at this point, we see nothing.  However, there is a\n",
    "  \"hidden\" directory called `.git/` which we can see by passing `-a`\n",

    "  ```\n",
    "  $ vi  README\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  Add some descriptive text to the file and save it.  At the moment,\n",

    "* Tell git about the file\n",
    "\n",
    "  Now we need to tell git to start tracking the file.  We use\n",
    "  `git add` for this.  Then we need to tell git to store the current\n",
    "  state of the file -- we use `git commit` for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  $ git add README\n",
    "  $ git commit README\n",

    "  descriptive message about the changes.\n",

    "  If you make more changes to the file, git won't store them until\n",
    "  you commit them.  So you'll commit the same file over and over as\n",

    "  `git log` will show you all the commits, the message you entered\n",
    "  when you made the commit (that helps you understand what was done).\n",
    "  It will also have a \"hash\" next to the commit (like\n",
    "  `dbc2916bb609759d54ca7668558bc639bab9b60b`)\n",

    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  $ git commit awesome.py \n",

    "  Suppose our code is not working anymore, and we know it was in the\n",
